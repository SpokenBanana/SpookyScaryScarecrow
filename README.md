====================

An RPG game I made as a final project for my CSC 130 class!

This project really is more than than what my assignment asked for, but after I was finished with the small parts of the game, I decided why not make it bigger? It stopped being about just getting a good grade and more about challenging myself. So I ended up creating this game!
